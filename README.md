# Luminance Detection in Unity3D

This repository provides a prototypical implementation of a luminance detector in Unity3D and is used for evaluation and as a showcase. The main functionalities are listed below. A detailed description can be found in the chapter <a href="https://github.com/samuelschnurr/luminance-detection#Demonstration">Demonstration</a>.

- Player handling
    - Input, camera, movement
- Enemy handling
    - Vision, navMesh movement
    - Detecting, following and forgetting the player 
- Jetpack with limited but reloading fuel
- Flashlight to put luminance on elements
- Luminance detection

## Before you start
- Install a compatible version of Unity (this repository is developed with <a href="https://unity3d.com/unity/qa/lts-releases?version=2019.4">Unity 2019.4.x</a>)
- Notice that you may show Gizmos to easilier understand enemy behaviour
